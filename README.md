# research-agent

`research-agent` is a local command-line tool for running research and optimization agent loops. Give it a question or goal, and it can search for evidence, run parallel research variants, critique claims, produce a paper-style report, and optionally optimize code or strategies against an evaluator.

The simple mental model:

```text
your prompt -> setup choices -> research/optimization loop -> report + artifacts
```

You do not need API keys to try it. Without keys, it uses the bundled local corpus and deterministic fallback model. Add OpenAI/Anthropic keys later for live model calls.

## Quick Start

Clone the repo and run the guided setup:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/michaelzoub/research-agent.git
cd research-agent
./autore
```

`./autore` with no arguments opens a selection-based setup. Use Up/Down to move through choices and Enter to select. The setup asks plain questions, then starts the run for you.

Optional install, so `autore` works from anywhere:

```bash
python3 -m pip install -e .
```

## First Run

Try a small research-only run first:

```bash
./autore
```

When asked for a goal, paste something like:

```text
Research how multi-agent systems improve automated literature review quality.
```

After the run finishes, look in:

```text
outputs/<run_name>/
```

The most useful files are:

| File | What to open first |
| --- | --- |
| `final_report.pdf` | Paper-style report. |
| `final_report_preview.png` | First-page image preview for IDEs. |
| `final_report.md` | Markdown version of the report. |
| `progress.txt` | Step-by-step log of what happened. |
| `run_benchmark.html` | Timeline and decision visuals. |
| `prd.json` | Task plan and pass/fail status. |
| `cost.json` | Model usage and estimated cost. |

## Selection-Based Setup

Run:

```bash
./autore
```

The guided setup asks for these choices:

| Setup step | What it means | Good default |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Goal | The question or task you want the agent to work on. Be specific about what evidence, report, or optimization result you want. | Your prompt |
| Run mode | What kind of work the harness should do. | Auto decide |
| Evaluator | The scoring function for optimization runs. Only matters for optimize or research-then-optimize. | Decide from prompt |
| Evidence source | Where research evidence should come from. | Auto mix |
| Iteration budget | How many outer-loop rounds the agent can spend improving the result. Higher means slower but deeper. | 3-12 |
| Model/lab | Which LLM to use, or whether to rotate through all configured models. | `all-configured` or OpenAI GPT-5.2 |

Run mode options:

| Option | Use when |
| --- | --- |
| Auto decide | You want the harness to infer the best mode from your prompt. |
| Research | You want sources, claims, caveats, and a final report. |
| Optimize | You already have an evaluator and want the agent to improve a candidate solution. |
| Research then optimize | You want the agent to research approaches first, then use that evidence to seed optimization. |

Evaluator options:

| Option | Use when |
| --- | --- |
| Decide from prompt | Best for most users. |
| `length_score` | Tiny demo evaluator for smoke tests. |
| `prediction_market` | Prediction-market challenge evaluator. |
| Custom name | Use when you have added your own evaluator in code. |

Evidence source options:

| Option | What it does |
| --- | --- |
| Auto mix | Chooses a mix of relevant retrievers. Best default. |
| Local corpus | Offline bundled demo corpus. Good for testing. |
| arXiv | Searches arXiv papers. |
| OpenAlex | Searches academic metadata and papers. |
| Semantic Scholar | Searches Semantic Scholar papers. |
| GitHub | Searches code/repository evidence. |
| Web | General web search. |
| Docs/blogs | Documentation and technical blog sources. |
| Twitter/X | Social/web trend evidence if configured. |
| Memory | Prior run artifacts and local world-model memory. |
| Alchemy | Blockchain data, requires `ALCHEMY_API_KEY`. |

You can start with a few flags but still use the menu:

```bash
./autore --interactive --retriever local
```

## Environment

Create `.env.local` for secrets and defaults:

```bash
OPENAI_API_KEY=sk-...
ANTHROPIC_API_KEY=sk-ant-...

RESEARCH_HARNESS_CORPUS_PATH=examples/corpus/research_corpus.json
RESEARCH_HARNESS_OUTPUT_DIR=outputs
RESEARCH_HARNESS_RETRIEVER=auto

RESEARCH_HARNESS_LLM_PROVIDER=auto
RESEARCH_HARNESS_LLM_MODEL=all-configured
RESEARCH_HARNESS_LLM_MODELS=openai/gpt-5.5,openai/gpt-5.2,anthropic/claude-opus-4-6,anthropic/claude-sonnet-4-6,anthropic/claude-sonnet-4-5,anthropic/claude-haiku-4-5,local/local-deterministic-fallback
```

`all-configured` uses every available model in `RESEARCH_HARNESS_LLM_MODELS` round-robin. Providers without a valid key are skipped. The local fallback keeps offline runs working.

## Examples

Research report:

```bash
./autore "Research enterprise AI agent adoption patterns" --task-mode research
```

Research first, then optimize:

```bash
./autore "Research approaches for improving a tiny scoring function" \
  --task-mode optimize_query \
  --evaluator length_score \
  --retriever local
```

Prediction-market challenge:

```bash
./autore "Get to \$10 profit in the prediction market challenge. Research strategy ideas first, then optimize." \
  --task-mode optimize_query \
  --evaluator prediction_market
```

Set `PREDICTION_MARKET_USE_UPSTREAM=1` to score through the real upstream CLI instead of the local proxy.

## Outputs

Each run creates `outputs/<NNN>_run_<slug>/`.

| `optimal_code.py` | Universal code artifact for the best selected candidate. |
| `solution.py` | Challenge-specific runnable solution when applicable. |
| `run_benchmark.html` | Per-run visual benchmark with Gantt timeline and decision DAG. |
| `run_notebook.ipynb` | Notebook export with trace summaries, artifact counts, cost, and diagnosis data. |

## Evaluation

Run the built-in eval suites:

```bash
python3 -m research_harness.evals --suite core
python3 -m research_harness.evals --suite edge
python3 -m research_harness.evals --suite all
```

The eval outputs go to `eval_outputs/`.

## Development

```bash
python3 -m unittest tests.test_smoke
python3 -m research_harness.evals --suite core --trials 1
./autore-bench
```
